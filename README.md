To compile the game clone the repo and launch from the root directory:
```
make
```
To start the game:
```
./cub3D ./srcs/maps/map1.cub
```
To make a screenshot of the first rendered frame (bmp format) add --save flag:
```
./cub3D ./srcs/maps/map1.cub --save
```
The project is written and tested on Mac OS. Moves in other systems is not guaranteed because of keymap ids differnce.
